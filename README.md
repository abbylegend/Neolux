How to use:

1. Save this code as script.js in the same folder as your HTML file.
2. In your HTML, replace the inline <script> block with:
   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```
3. Make sure your HTML file includes the necessary element IDs (store-grid, cartItems, etc.) as used in the script. The provided HTML from the previous responses already contains all required IDs.
